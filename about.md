I'm a Post Doctoral Researcher at the University of Minnesota and a member of the Zooniverse team.  My work focuses on the application of Aritificial Intelligence to the [zooniverse.org][zoo] citizen science platform.  My aim is to help researchers achieve their science goals through citizen science and  empower our volunteers to make ever greater contributions to science.

I also run the [Supernova Hunters][snhunters] citizen science project where we showed how the [combination of machine learning and humans outperforms either alone][snhunters_paper].  Previously, I was at Queen's University Belfast where I worked on the Pan-STARRS1 survey and developed [models to help discover Supernovae][ps1_ml].  This approach has been applied to a number of telescopes and is contributing to the search for [optical counterparts to Gravitational Wave detections][gw_followup].
